    <h1>The Beginning of Humanity</h1>

    <p>The story of humanity is a long and fascinating journey that began millions of years ago. Scientists believe that modern humans, known as <em>Homo sapiens</em>, first appeared in Africa around <strong>300,000 years ago</strong>. From there, humans began to explore, migrate, and settle in different parts of the world.</p>

    <p>In the earliest days, humans survived by hunting animals and gathering wild plants. They formed small groups and lived in caves and open lands. Over time, they began to develop tools, control fire, and create simple shelters. This period is known as the <strong>Stone Age</strong>.</p>

    <p>As centuries passed, humans discovered farming, built villages, and started trading. These changes gave birth to great civilizations like <strong>Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley</strong>. Each civilization contributed to knowledge, writing, and technology.</p>

    <p>Humanityâ€™s story is a mix of struggle, discovery, wars, growth, and survival. From the first steps in Africa to space exploration today, our history shows that humans are always searching, learning, and moving forward.</p>
